## Online Shop

## This is an online shop for the band Linkin Park. <br>
### It is not a real shop of course, but you can buy stuff as I've linked real Linkin Park's website here <br>
### I'm just practicing my Javascript skills to make a cart and make it like real. <br>
### I made sure, you can't put in negative number orders, the cart updates automatically with the increasing quantity and all the buttons work.
### If you press the purchase button without anything in the cart it'll check that and let you know that you need to add something in the cart first to place order.
### Only when you add something to cart thn press purchase it'll thank you for your purchase.
### Nothing too fancy but good to see it's working just fine.
